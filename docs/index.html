<b>Cognat.es</b> is an OpenSource project created by people just like <i>you</i>, with a strong interest in improving their knowledge of languages.  Most cognate resources on the web today are created and shared from a purely linguist and academic viewpoint.  At Cognat.es we are building the largest collection of very special subset of cognates with the sole purpose of kickstarting your language learning.  The special set of cognates we are collecting are the ones that have kept their near same sound and meaning from language to language.  By gathering these cognates into one centralized site we are able to offer simple and easy to access tools to help you in your language journey.
